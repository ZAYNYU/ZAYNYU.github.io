I worked in the Space Time Analysis Bayes <a href = "https://sae4health.stat.uw.edu/team/STAB_group/"> [(STAB)] </a> Lab, led by professor Jon Wakefield at the University of Washington. 

I analyzed large-scale survey data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) to assess key child health indicators—including neonatal mortality rate (NMR), vaccination coverage across multiple middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Laos. This work contributed to a presentation at the “Children's Lives: International Conference on Children and Their Families using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS),” delivered by Professor Jon Wakefield.

I also worked on streamlined analysis pipelines for MICS surveys in the <a href = "https://rsc.stat.washington.edu/surveyPrevRShinyMICS/"> [R Shiny app], which applied small area estimation techniques to produce subnational estimates in LMICs.
