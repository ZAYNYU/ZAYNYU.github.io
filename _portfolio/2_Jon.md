I analyzed large-scale survey data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) to assess key child health indicators—including neonatal mortality rate (NMR), vaccination coverage, and stunting—across multiple countries such as Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Laos. We applied small area estimation techniques to generate subnational estimates that provide more granular insights into public health disparities. This work contributed to a presentation at the “Children's Lives: International Conference on Children and Their Families using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS),” delivered by Professor Jon Wakefield.
