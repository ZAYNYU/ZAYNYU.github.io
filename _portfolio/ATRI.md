I contributed to the preparation of the final analysis for the MIND Study—a Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The study investigates whether the use of nicotine, delivered via transdermal patch, can safely improve memory and functioning in individuals diagnosed with mild memory loss or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

My contributions included deriving standardized analysis datasets (ADaM/SDTM), coding scoring functions for key clinical outcomes using R, and developing visualizations of the study flow, including a CONSORT diagram. I also authored the Safety Analysis Report, which provided a detailed summary and evaluation of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and deaths.

At the end of the internship, I presented the work to over 100 members of the institution.

This framework for final analysis was developed using real trial data (with treatment assignments still blinded, as a few participants were ongoing). By proactively setting up this framework, we significantly reduced the time and pressure on the biostatistics team to deliver the final results once the trial ends.
