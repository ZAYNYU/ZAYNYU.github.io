In this project, we reviewed existing protocols and grant applications for adaptive trials to summarize commonly used patterns for reporting and communicating sample size, we also identified and discussed potential gaps in the current practice of sample size estimation in adaptive trials. I reviewed 37 clinical trial protocols with adaptive designs, verified sample size calculations, and provided recommendations for improving how sample size calculations should be presented in adaptive trials. This work resulted in a co-authored publication, "Reporting and Communication of Sample Size Calculations in Adaptive Clinical Trials: A Review of Trial Protocols and Grant Applications" published in BMC Medical Research Methodology <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-024-02339-7">[paper] </a>.
