I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, working with Professor [Jing Ma](https://drjingma.com/) and Professor [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). Prior to that, I earned my MS in Biostatistics at Yale University, where I was advised by Professor [Hongyu Zhao](https://zhaocenter.org/) and Professor [Jingfei Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/ejzhang/home?authuser=0). Before graduate school, I earned undergraduate degrees in Biotechnology from Fudan University, where I worked with Professor [Xiaolei Lin](https://xiaolei-lin.github.io/).
