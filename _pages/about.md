I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, working with Professors [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/) and [Ali Shojaie](https://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/) on semi-supervised learning. I also work with Professor Jing Ma (https://drjingma.com/) on microbiome network models. Prior to that, I earned my MS in Biostatistics at Yale University, where I was advised by Professors [Hongyu Zhao](https://zhaocenter.org/) and [Jingfei Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/ejzhang/home?authuser=0). Before graduate school, I earned undergraduate degrees in Biotechnology from Fudan University, where I worked with Professor [Xiaolei Lin](https://xiaolei-lin.github.io/).
