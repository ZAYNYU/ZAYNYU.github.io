I got my MS in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I worked with Professor [Jon Wakefield](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/) on spatial analysis and Professor [James Hughes](https://faculty.washington.edu/jphughes/) on cluster randomized trials. I earned my BS in Statistics at the University of Nottingham. During my undergraduate, I worked with Professor [Steven Julious](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/people/academic/population-health/steven-julious) and Dr. [Munya Dimairo](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/people/academic/population-health/munya-dimairo) on sample size estimation for adaptive trials.
